      <h2>About This Platform</h2>
      <p>
        This platform was created to delve into the intersection of warfare,
        geopolitics, and their deep-rooted effects on societies worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, we aim to shed light on overlooked narratives, critical analysis
        of modern strategies, and the shifting balance of power among global
        players.
      </p>
      <p>
        With each article, we hope to bring a deeper understanding of conflict â€”
        not just as a military phenomenon, but as a humanitarian crisis that
        affects generations.

              Hi! My name is Saptarshi. I am an aspiring software developer
              based in India. Warfare, Armaments, Armed Forces, Strategy,... I
              am curious about everything.
            </p>
            <p>
              My friends think I like warfare just because I watch a lot of
              action movies but that is abosolutely not the case.I do understand
              the loss and devastation that comes with it. Not that I don't
              admire a good movie now and then.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope by peeking into our past and obtaining valuable lessons,
              may we avoid future wars.
            </p>
